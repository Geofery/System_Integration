Can explain the difference between data scraping and web crawling.


Data Scraping: 
- Web scraping is all about the data - the data fields you want to extract from specific websites.
- And with web scraping, you usually have a lot more fields - 5-10-20 or more data fields. The URL can be one, but when you scrape, you extract the data not necessarily for the URL but for other data fields that are displayed on the website. 

Web crawling: 
- don't know the specific URLs and you probably don't know the domains either. And this is the reason you crawl: you want to find the URLs. So that you can do something with them late
- With web crawling the output is a lot more simple because it's just a list of URLs

Can web scrape in a language.
